And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because

My loneliness is killin' me

When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you
Boy, you've got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby, there's nothin' that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now

Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

My loneliness is killin' me

When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
