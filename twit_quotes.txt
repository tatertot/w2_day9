I don't know who Maxime thinks she's kidding. If Hagrid's halfgiant, she definitely is. Big bones... the only thing that's got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur. 
 
Pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours broom, Malfoy. Then it could catch the Snitch for you. 
 
I don't go looking for trouble. Trouble usually finds me. 
 
Are you insane? Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can I move in? 
 
Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He's already used you as bait once, and that was just because you're my best friend's sister. Think how much danger you'll be in if we keep this up. He'll know, he'll find out. He'll try and get to me through you. 
 
He was my mum and dad's best friend. He's a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though...keep up with news...check if I'm happy... 
 
Brilliant! It's Potions last thing on Friday! Snape won't have the time to poison us all! 
 
Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher. There was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head! 
 
Well, I had one that I was playing Quidditch the other night, said Ron, screwing up his face in an effort to remember. What do you think that means?
Probably that you're going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something, said Harry, turning the pages of The Dream Oracle without interest. 
 
And Harry said last night, retorted Ron, if it means we're supposed to get matey with the Slytherins, fat chance.
Well, I think it's a pity we're not trying for a bit of interHouse unity, said Hermione crossly.
They had reached the foot of the marble staircase. A line of fourthyear Ravenclaws was crossing the entrance hall; they caught sight of Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though frightened he might attack stragglers.
Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that, said Harry sarcastically. 
 
Harry, don't go picking a row with Malfoy, don't forget, he's a prefect now, he could make life difficult for you...
Wow, I wonder what it'd be like to have a difficult life? said Harry sarcastically. 
 
How long have you been 'Big D' then? said Harry.
Shut it, snarled Dudley, turning away again.
Cool name, said Harry, grinning, but you'll always be Ickle Diddykins to me.
Shut your face.
You don't tell her Aunt Petunia to shut her face. What about 'popkin' and 'Dinky Diddydums,' can I use them then? 
 
Listen, if you Fred and George don't take it the gold, I'm throwing it down the drain. I don't want it and I don't need it. But I could do with a few laughs. We could all do with a few laughs. I've got a feeling we're going to need them more than usual before long. 
 
You can't give a Dementor the old onetwo! 
 
Why were you lurking under our window?
Yes  yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our windows, boy?
Listening to the news, said Harry in a resigned voice.
His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.
Listening to the news! Again?
Well, it changes every day, you see, said Harry. 
 
Er  thanks very much, Ernie, said Harry, taken aback. Ernie might be pompous on occasions like these, but Harry was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who was not wearing radishes in their ears. 
 
Proud? said Harry. Are you crazy? All those times I could've died, and I didn't manage it? They'll be furious.... 
 
Cut it out, he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded again. First sign of madness, talking to your own head, said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall. 
 
You know your mother, Malfoy? The expression on her face  like she's got dung under her nose? Is she like that all the time or just because you were with her? 
 
He Dumbledore will only be gone from the school when none are loyal to him. 
 
It's just hard, Harry said finally, in a low voice, to realize he won't write me again. 
 
I realised I cant shut myself away or crack up. It could be me next, couldnt it? But if it is, Ill make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can and Voldemort too, if I can manage it. 
 
Snape killed Dumbledore. 
 
Dumbledore's man through and through, said Harry. That's right. 
 
Wow... look at that... he's not here now! So why not have a go? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband! 
 
Well, think back, said Harry. Have you ever let it slip that you'd like to go out in public with the words 'My Sweetheart' round your neck? 
 
Warrington's aim's so pathetic I'd be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me. 
 
She's Ron's sister.
But she's ditched Dean!
She's still Ron's sister.
I'm his best mate!
That'll make it worse.
If I talked to him first
He'd hit you.
What if I don't care?
He's your best mate! 
 
To Mundungus What did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place? 
 
I like a quiet life, you know me. 
 
And they'd the Death Eaters love to have me, said Harry sarcastically. We'd be best pals if they didn't keep trying to do me in. 
 
SHE KILLED SIRIUS! SHE KILLED HIM  I'LL KILL HER! 
 
They don't know know we're not allowed to use magic at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer... 
 
There's no need to call me sir Professor. 
 
Do you think  do you think I give a  I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO SAY! Harry roared. I don't want to hear anything you've got to say! 
 
SO WHAT? Harry shouted. Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of the stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the stone, well, I'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember? 
 
Yeah, and others might say it's your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison, said Harry, his temper rising now. You're doing what Barty Crouch did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we've got Fudge, pretending everything's lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we've got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you've got 'the Chosen One' working for you! 
 
No, it was honest, said Harry. One of the only honest things you've said to me. You don't care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you're winning the war against Voldemort. 
 
You can try, said Harry indifferently. But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I'd have thought you'd have learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he's not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore's still headmaster. I'd leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you. 
 
I'm going to Hagrid's, I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's. 
 
This is night, Diddykins. That's what we call it when it goes all dark like this. 
 
Severus Snape wasn't yours, said Harry. Snape was Dumbledores, Dumbledores from the moment you started hunting down my mother... 
 
Albus Severus..you were named for the two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew. 
 
Snapes patronus was a doe. The same as my mothers, because he loved her for nearly all his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realised. De asked you to spare herlife, didn't he? 
 
Theyre evacuating the younger kids and everyones meeting in the Great Hall to get organized, Harry said. Were fighting. 
 
 Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone I loved. Noble, even. That ought to count for something.

 When life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations, it’s not reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end.

 My primary motivation behind buying a car, despite the scarcity of my funds, was that I refused to be driven around town in a car with red and blue lights on top. Nothing slows down traffic like a cop.

 I do a good job of blocking painful, unnecessary things from my memory.

 The thing, I thought to myself… it had possibilities — as a nickname, at the very least.

 Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain.

 Forks must be a difficult place for you to live.
    
Bella? Are you all right?
  
Trust me.
    
No blood, no foul.
    
Someone has to spread the good news that we survived.
    
I saved your life – I don’t owe you anything.
    
You think I lifted a van off you?

    
I hope you enjoy disappointment.
  
It’s better if we’re not friends. Trust me.


     
You think I regret saving your life?

    
Bella, it’s not my fault if you are exceptionally unobservant.

  
Bella, you are utterly absurd.

Edward Cullen, Twilight, Chapter 4, p.82
     
The wasting of finite resources is everyone’s business.

I said it would be better if we weren’t friends, not that I didn’t want to be.
    
It would be more… prudent for you not to be my friend. But I’m tired of trying to stay away from you, Bella.

I'd never given much thought to how I would die — though I'd had reason enough in the last few months — but even if I had, I would not have imagined it like this.

I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of the hunter, and he looked pleasantly back at me.

Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone I loved. Noble, even. That ought to count for something.

I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be facing death now. But, terrified as I was, I couldn't bring myself to regret the decision. When life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations, it's not reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end.

The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered forward to kill me.


Strange, unpopular names, I thought. The kinds of names grandparents had. But maybe that was in vogue here — small town names? I finally remembered that my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly common name. There were two girls named Jessica in my History class back home.

"They are… very nice-looking." I struggled with the conspicuous understatement.

"Yes!" Jessica agreed with another giggle. "They're all together though — Emmett and Rosalie, and Jasper

and Alice, I mean. And they live together." Her voice held all the shock and condemnation of the small town, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I had to admit that even in Phoenix, it would cause gossip.

"Which ones are the Cullens?" I asked. "They don't look related…"

"Oh, they're not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his twenties or early thirties. They're all adopted. The Hales are brother and sister, twin

He didn't come, and as time passed I grew more and more tense.

I walked to Biology with more confidence when, by the end of lunch, he still hadn't showed. Mike, who was taking on the qualities of a golden retriever, walked faithfully by my side to class. I held my breath at the door, but Edward Cullen wasn't there, either. I exhaled and went to my seat. Mike followed, talking about an upcoming trip to the beach.

He lingered by my desk till the bell rang. Then he smiled at me wistfully and went to sit by a girl with braces and a bad perm. It looked like I was going to have to do something about Mike, and it wouldn't be easy. In a town like this, where everyone lived on top of everyone else, diplomacy was essential. I had never been enormously tactful; I had no practice dealing with overly friendly boys.

I was relieved that I had the desk to myself, that Edward was absent. I told myself that repeatedly. But I couldn't get rid of the nagging suspicion that I was the reason he wasn't there. It was ridiculous, and egotistical, to think that I could affect anyone that strongly. It was impossible. And yet I couldn't stop worrying that it was true.
